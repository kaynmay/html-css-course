## HTML Fundamentals

- HyperText Markup Language
  - Structure and describe the content of a webpage
- HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content
  - Paragraphs, links, headings, images, etc
  - Made up of opening tag (`<p>`), content, and the ending tag (`</p>`)
  - If an element has no content the ending tag is omitted
- Basic structure of an HTML page
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>` goes at the top of the file and tells the browser that this document uses HTML
  - Next is the html tags, `<html></html>`
  - Then the head elements (`<head></head>`) which are for things that are not visible in the browser window
    - Page title, information about the page, link to CSS, etc
  - Then the body elements (`<body></body>`) which are for things that are visible in the browser window
- Comment in HTML with `<!--` and close with `-->`
- Use `<strong></strong>` to make text bold instead of `<b></b>`
- Use `<em></em>` to make text bold instead of `<i></i>`
